# Customer Retention Revenue Analysis – TheLook Ecommerce

## Project Objective
Evaluate revenue dependency on new versus returning customers and identify actions to improve customer retention efficiency.

## Business Context
Initial exploration revealed strong revenue growth driven primarily by new customers. This raised concerns about long-term sustainability and retention performance.

## Data & Tools
- Dataset: BigQuery public dataset (thelook_ecommerce)
- SQL: Data exploration, validation, and customer classification
- Power BI: Data modeling, measures, and interactive dashboard

## Analytical Approach
1. Explored raw transactional data to understand structure and revenue source.
2. Validated data range and business scale.
3. Established total revenue and yearly performance baseline.
4. Classified customers based on first purchase date.
5. Measured revenue dependency on new vs returning customers.

## Key Insight
Approximately **87% of total revenue** is generated by **new customers**, indicating weak contribution from returning customers.

## Business Decision
Launch a post-purchase email reminder **30 days after the first purchase** to encourage repeat buying behavior.

## Success Metrics
- Returning customer revenue percentage
- Repeat purchase rate within 60 days

## Fallback Decision
If no improvement is observed after 60 days, introduce **personalized incentives after 90 days** for non-returning customers.
